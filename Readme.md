# Utilities for OS X / Linux

I thought I'd make a github repo for all the commandline tools / utilites I've developed. These are open source so feel free to modify / use them as you like.

# Included Files:

Makefile -> Produces executable binaries in the "bin" output folder

And of course the Source Code....

process_location.c -> Given a PID return the process's relative path to stdout
